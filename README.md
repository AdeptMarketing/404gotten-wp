# Instant 404gotten.org Page for Wordpress

A Wordpress plugin that makes implementing the missing child
404 page provided by [404gotten.org](http://404gotten.org) super easy, instead of futzing
with Apache or modifying your theme code.

## Installing

Hopefully this plugin will be approved by Wordpress.org soon., so it'll go into
their repository.  Until then, you can always [grab the zip file](https://github.com/AdeptMarketing/404gotten-wp/archive/master.zip) and upload it to your server.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! I'll review and merge any pull requests as soon as I can.
