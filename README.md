# Instant NotFound.org 404 Page for Wordpress

A Wordpress plugin that makes implementing the missing child
404 page provided by [notfound.org](http://notfound.org) super easy, instead of futzing
with Apache or modifying your theme code.

## Something Interesting

At the time that I'm writing this, there are something like ~57 million
Wordpress sites on the internet.

According to [TechCrunch](http://en.wordpress.com/stats/), Wordpress accounts for
nearly 17% of the internet's top one million most-trafficked sites.

If everyone installed this plugin, that would be a lot of eyeballs helping
find missing kids.
