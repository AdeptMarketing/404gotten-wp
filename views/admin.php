<p> 
    If you're seeing this page, the plugin is active. You can make sure it's working by
    visiting a page that probably doesn't exist. List this one:
</p>
<p>
    <a target="_blank" href="<?php echo site_url() ?>/this-page-is-probably-a-404"><?php echo site_url() ?>/this-page-is-probably   -a-404</a>
</p>
<p>
    There currently aren't any settings for the NotFound.org plugin.
    But as features and other customizations are requested, you might find some here.
</p>
